                Our residential facility is named Megan’s Place. It is named in the memory
                of a special young woman and her fight to overcome substance use
                disorder. Her struggle is the inspiration for our 90 day program, allowing
                more time for healing and assistance. Her memory is part of our passion to
                empower every woman to live life free to be all she can be.
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle mb-3">
                Megan’s Place is a safe environment for spiritual, emotional, mental and
                physical healing. It provides a peaceful atmosphere to reflect, learn and
                heal. Women have their own private bedroom and bathroom, with a shared
                living space and kitchen in a newly renovated residential care facility. Day-
                to-day living necessities and access to Medication Assisted Treatment and
                counseling is provided as well as classes and recovery groups.
            </p>

                We know that healthy family support is imperative for a sustainable
                recovery and Megan’s Place has a family room and children’s area.
                Women will have the opportunity to receive visits from their children and
                other friends and family members who are linked to their recovery.
                Whenever possible, we will provide on-site day care.
